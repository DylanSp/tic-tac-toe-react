# Yet Another React Tic-Tac-Toe

[Play this app on GitHub Pages!](https://dylansp.github.io/tic-tac-toe-react/)

This project is a simple client-side tic-tac-toe game, using Typescript and React. It's a learning experience for me to practice Typescript/React and learn some design/frontend development techniques. I'm also using this project to learn tools such as Travis CI and coveralls.io.
